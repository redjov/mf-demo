# Module Federation Demo

This is a demo of Module Federation in Webpack 5 
with React, Material UI and TypeScript.
Both apps act as hosts and remotes, 
where each app consumes a component exported 
from the other.

### Install dependencies
`yarn install`

### Run the apps in development mode
`yarn start`

### Build the apps
`yarn build`

### Serve the apps after building
`yarn serve`
